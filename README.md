# sparkify_churn_prediction
Sparkify is a dataset of a music streaming service provided by Udacity. The dataset contains activity logs of different users on the streaming service. A subset of 128MB is provided for development.

### Problem Statement
The objective is to identify users who are going to churn or exit the music streaming service. The data provides logs of user activities such as next song, home, cancel. Based on this data, i should prepare a dataset that i can use to model a binary classifier to predict users who may or may not churn.

#### Libraries used
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Pyspark.sql
- Pyspark.ml

#### Files included in the repository
- Sparkify.ipynb - Jupyter notebook that contains the code used to load, clean, analyse and model the data.
